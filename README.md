### Test- Submission

The following indicates what I managed to do from the front-end web development test. 

#### Section 1:

</p>
Managed to create a signup form that includes the relevant details i.e phone number. Done through bulma css

#### Section 2:

Basic card view implementation. Research on cnstructors in polymer helped to display each element correctly. 
Also I did some styling on each card when you hover over each. 

#### Section 3:
I attempted this section to no success. By far the most challenging part. 
I will continue working on the section to help understand what I have done wrong. 
* [src/my_view3.js](src/my-view3.js/)

#### Section 4;
I was able to sort the arrays in ascending order as seen below. 
My apologies for not displaying them with cards due to my problem with section three.

##### All in all, this was a good test and I need to learn more on polymer and bulma. ####
